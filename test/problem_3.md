Add your answer to problem 3 below.

Video 1:
One thing that I learned from this video is that you should track any
opportunities you may have missed in the past in order to make sure you don't
miss out in the future. My general takeaway is that you should focus on
personal growth and improvement, something that I suppose could be applied to
this class if you squint REALLY hard. On a side note, I believe that this video
is extremely inappropriate for what this class is supposed to teach. The
homework should focus on "Data Structures, Algorithms, and Discrete
Mathematics", not how to day trade like a stocks NPC. I understand the
intention is to emphasize the importance of capitalizing on career
opportunities, but the same lesson could have been taught with a *CSSE* related
video.

Video 2:
This video was significantly more interesting and relevant than the previous,
particularly because I have been using Go for my project in CSS 360. Although
it didn't teach me anything new about Go or writing tests, it did give me some
valuable insight into test driven development. My main takeaway from the video
is that tests should be used to help you decide what code to write next. Prior
to watching, I had always thought of testing as a chore and, as a result, had
despised writing tests. This video made me realize that writing tests
beforehand via TDD helps you figure out the steps you need to take towards
getting your application working.
